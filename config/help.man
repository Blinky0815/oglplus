.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
.B \-h --help
Prints this help screen.

.TP
.B --prefix <PATH>
Specifies the installation prefix. The path

.TP
.B --build-dir <PATH>
Specifies the work directory for \fBcmake\fR,
where the cached files, generated makefiles
and the intermediate build files will be
placed [_build].
The specified path must be either absolute
or relative to the current working directory
from which configure is invoked.

.TP
.B --include-dir <PATH>
Specifies additional directory to search
when looking for external headers like
\fIGL/glew.h\fR or \fIGL3/gl3.h\fR.
The specified path must be absolute or
relative to the current working directory
from which configure is invoked.
This option may be specified multiple times
to add multiple directories to the search list.

.TP
.B --library-dir <PATH>
Specifies additional directory to search
when looking for compiled libraries like
\fBGL\fR, \fBGLEW\fR, \fBglut\fR, \fBpng\fR, etc.
The specified path must be absolute or relative

configure is invoked.
This option may be specified multiple times
to add multiple directories to the search list.

.TP
.B \- --cmake
Everything following this option will be
passed to \fBcmake\fR verbatim.

.TP
.B --dry-run
Only print the commands that would be executed
without actually executing them.

.TP
.B --from-scratch
Remove any previous cached and intermediate files
and run the configuration process from scratch.

.TP
.B --use-gl3-h
Force use of the GL3/gl3.h header. If this option is used,
then this header must be installed somewhere
in the system include directories or in directories
specified with \fI--include-dir\fR.
The \fI--use-glcorearb-h\fR, \fI--use-gl3-h\fR, \fI--use-glew\fR
and \fI--use-gl3w\fR
options are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.B --use-glcorearb-h
Force use of the GL/glcorearb.h header. If this option is used,
then this header must be installed somewhere
in the system include directories or in directories
specified with \fI--include-dir\fR.
The \fI--use-glcorearb-h\fR, \fI--use-gl3-h\fR, \fI--use-glew\fR
and \fI--use-gl3w\fR
options are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.B --use-glew
Force use of the GLEW library. If this option is used, then
GLEW and the \fIGL/glew.h\fR header must be installed somewhere
in the system include directories or in directories
specified with \fI--include-dir\fR.
The \fI--use-glcorearb-h\fR, \fI--use-gl3-h\fR, \fI--use-glew\fR
and \fI--use-gl3w\fR
options are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.B --use-gl3w
Force use of the GL3W library. If this option is used, then
GL3W and the \fIGL/gl3w.h\fR header must be installed somewhere

The \fI--use-glcorearb-h\fR, \fI--use-gl3-h\fR, \fI--use-glew\fR
and \fI--use-gl3w\fR
options are mutually exclusive.


.TP
.B --use-wxgl
Force use of the wxGL library. If this option is used, then
wxWidgets and the \fIwx/glcanvas.h\fR header must be installed somewhere

.TP
.B --no-examples
Do not build the examples and the textures.

.TP
.B --screenshots
Also make screenshots from the example applications
for the documentation.  This is still experimental
and currently works only with \fIGL3/gl3.h\fR + \fBGLX\fR.

.TP
.B --framedump
Build the examples in a mode where the individual
frames have fixed timing and are dumped into separate
files which can be later encoded into a video sequence.
This is still experimental and currently works only
with \fIGL3/gl3.h\fR + \fBGLX\fR.

.TP
.B --no-docs
